# Week1 meeting - 28/03/2020
  ## MOM:
    Discussed on the project, various data resources and set the agenda for next week, 
    that is, understanding dataset and coming up with ideas
  ## Individual Activities:
    Amol - Explore and dataset understanding, Created Group in MS_Teams, conducted project meeting, Created GitHub repository for project
    Anurag - Explore and dataset understanding 
    Bindu - Explore and dataset understanding 
    Frederick - Explore and dataset understanding
    Jyothi - Explore and dataset understanding 
    Luke - Explore and dataset understanding 
    Nishant - Explore and dataset understanding


# Week2 meeting - 04/04/2020
  ## MOM:
    Discussed on the dataset, and difficulties faced. Agreed on the next week goal, to do the pre-processing step of the project. 
    Decided on to do the pre-processing i.e., data cleaning and manipulation in SAS, R and python separately in the groups of 2 or 3.

  ## Individual Activities:
    Amol     - Dataset exploration, proposed the steps to follow to complete the project, 
    visit (https://github.com/NanawareAmol/Project_Portuguese_Banking/blob/master/Steps.txt) for more details.
    Anurag   - Dataset exploration
    Bindu    - Dataset exploration
    Alex     - Dataset exploration
    Jyothi   - Dataset exploration
    Luke     - Dataset exploration
    Nishant  - Dataset exploration

  ## Goal: Pre-processing
    Amol     - Python
    Anurag   - SAS
    Bindu    - R
    Alex     - SAS
    Jyothi   - R
    Luke     - SAS
    Nishant  - Python

# Week3 meeting - 11/04/2020
  ## MOM:
    Discussed on the dataset, and difficulties faced while cleaning the data. Agreed on the next week goal, to do the task of completing pre-processing steps and fitting the model. 
    Decided on working on each of the laguages separately in the team of 2 or 3 and after completiong we will be comparing the data accuracy using LDA and model accuracy using cross validation.
  
  ## Individual Activities:
    Amol     - Data pre-processing and model fitting in Python
    Nishant  - Data pre-processing and model fitting in Python
    Anurag   - Data pre-processing and model fitting in SAS
    Luke     - Data pre-processing and model fitting in SAS
    Alex     - Data pre-processing and model fitting in SAS
    Bindu    - Data pre-processing and model fitting in R
    Jyothi   - Data pre-processing and model fitting in R
